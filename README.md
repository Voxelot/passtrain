# Passtrain: The Password Trainer

Passtrain is a cli app that helps you learn new passwords through repetition.

Passtrain works by prompting you for a password that you want to memorize, 
and then prompts you to renter it repeatedly while progressively increasing
the difficulty of the hint with each successful entry.
If you're unable to remember your new password, Passtrain will gradually lower the difficulty
of the hint until you're able to recall the password.
